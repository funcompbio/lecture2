## The Unix operating system

.pull-left[
* An _operating system_ (OS) is a software that enables the use and manipulation
  of the different physical devices forming a computer.

* The Unix OS ([Ritchie and Thompson, 1974](https://doi.org/10.1145/361011.361061);
  [Kernighan and Pike, 1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment))
  was born on 1969 as a result of a research project
  at [Bell-Labs](http://www.bell-labs.com/history/unix), USA.

## The Unix operating system

* The group of engineers that developed Unix already made other attempts to
  develop an OS in the 60s, such as [Multics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics).

* However, only after they developed the
  [B programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28programming_language%29)
  they succeeded to develop the first version of Unix, which was written in this language.

* The [B programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28programming_language%29)
  was the precursor of the widely-used [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29)
  ([Kernighan and Ritchie, 1978)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).

* There are many [variants](https://www.levenez.com/unix) of Unix, one of the most
  popular ones is [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) but also
  [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29),
  [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS)
  and [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) are based on a Unix OS.

* Did they use the Unix OS 50 years ago in the same way we use it now?

## The Unix operating system

* The Unix OS is organized into **layers**.  

![:scale 50%](img/unixlayers.png)

* The [_graphical user interface_ (GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)
  layer appeared later and the Unix OS was conceived to be used through the
  shell layer.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* The [_shell_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) layer is a
  [_command-line user interface_ (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
  that allows the user to interact with the computer by writing commands through a
  [_computer terminal_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal) or a
  [_terminal emulator_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator).

## The terminal window

![](img/terminals.png)

---

## The terminal window

* Nowadays, every OS (Windows, macOS or Linux) starts up with a GUI.

* The terminal window is just an application with an icon similar to this one:

  ![:scale 5%](img/terminal-app-icon.png)

* In Linux is located next to every other application.

* In macOS is located in `Applications -> Utilities`.

* In Windows you need to install some Unix emulator such as
  [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org) (using its Git Bash application).

* Other options for Windows in increasing order of complexity are:

  * Running a Unix system in the [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)
  and access it through the browser. You require a stable internet connection and you
  normally have to pay for it.
  * Running a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) and installing
  in it a Linux system.
  * [Partitioning the hard drive disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning)
  and install Windows in one of the partitions and Linux in the other one.

---

## The terminal window

* At this point, you may ask yourself why do we want to work with a Unix command-line in
  a terminal window.

* The answer is because the command-line allows you to use computing in a
  modular, efficient and reproducible way:

  * Modularity: reusing and chaining computations.
  * Efficiency: automatizing workflows.
  * Reproducibility: recording computing steps.

* In summary, the command-line facilitates the release of your full potential as a computational biologist..

## The Unix filesystem

* A fundamental component of any OS is the [filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system)
  that the OS uses to store data.

* The filesystem determines the way in which files are organized and the GUIs in currently available
  OSs provide a graphical interface to this organisation.

* We want to learn here how to work with the filesystem through the Unix command-line:

  * High-level understanding about how the filesystem stores files in the computer.

  * Learn filesystem commands and the syntax to specify them in the shell.

---

## The Unix filesystem

* A graphical representation of the Unix file system is through a
  [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard), sometimes
  referred to as a tree.

![:scale 90%](img/sfitxers.jpg)

* We have two main types of files in the filesystem: regular files and directories.

* Directories can store regular files and other directories.

* On top of the hierarchy we have the [root directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_directory),
  which can be likened to the trunk of a tree, as the starting point where all branches
  originate from.

---

## The Unix filesystem

* [Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29): unique location in the filesystem
  represented by a sequence of directories, optionally ending with a regular file, separated by
  the slash character `/`, for instance, `/home/professor/notes`  

![:scale 90%](img/sfitxers.jpg)

* When we start the shell in a terminal window, we have by default access to a specific
  working directory in the filesystem: our [home directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory),
  which can be coded in a path by writing the tilde character (`~`), e.g., `~/notes`    

---

## The Unix filesystem

* [Current working directory (CWD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory):
  directory where we have default access, which can be coded in a path by
  writing a dot (`.`), for instance, `./notes`

![:scale 90%](img/sfitxers.jpg)

* **Previous directory**: directory containing the CWD, which can be coded in a
  path by two consecutive dots (`..`): `../examens`  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* **Absolute path**: path starting at the root directory: `/home/professor/notes`  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* **Relative path**: path starting at some given CWD: `./notes`, `../examens`, etc.

---

## Unix commands

The syntax of Unix commands is the following:

`$ command [options] [arguments]`

where

  * **$**: is the [command prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command_prompt),
  which we **should not** write and merely indicates that the rest of the line should be written in
  the shell.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * **command**: is the name of the instruction that we want to execute. For instance, to
  copy a file we should use the command `cp`.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * **options**: one or more words starting with a hyphen (`-`) separated by spaces, i.e.,
  `-r` or `-lha`, that tune the behavior of the command.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * **arguments**: one or more words separated by spaces that specify input information that
  the command needs to perform its task.

The (square) brackets `[` and `]` are used above to indicate that not all commands have options
and arguments.

---

## Unix file commands

Examples of Unix commands that manipulate files:

  * listing files:

    `$ ls`

  * copying files:

    `$ cp ~/Downloads/data.zip .`

  * removing files:

    `$ rm data.zip`

  * changing CWD:

    `$ cd data`

---

## Unix commands to explore file contents

Examples of Unix commands that explore the contents of [text files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file):

  * beginning of a text file:

    `$ head filename`

  * end of a text file:

    `$ tail filename`

  * whole text file:

    `$ cat filename`

  * paging text files:

    `$ more filename`

---

## Redirecting terminal output to a file

* Unix offers a mechanism to
[redirect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_%28computing%29)
to a file, the output printed in the terminal window.

`$ command > file`

![TerminalOutputRedirection](img/terminaloutputredirection.png)

## Concluding remarks

* Most Unix filesystems are case-sensitive, a wrong upper-case letter may lead to an error.
  Syntax must be precise and the
  [devil is in the detail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_devil_is_in_the_detail).  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
--

* The shell interprets commands by reading words separated by space characters.
  Using space characters in filenames becomes problematic in the command line.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
--

* **DO NOT** use spaces or any other non-standard
  [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) character such as `ñ`, `ç`,
  accents, etc., in filenames.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
--

* **DO NOT** use spaces or any other non-standard
  [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) character such as `ñ`, `ç`,
  accents, etc., in filenames.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
--

* Use [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)
  (e.g., `raw_data.csv`) or [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)
  (e.g., `rawData.csv`) instead of spaces to specify meaningful filenames.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
--

* You do not learn Unix and the command line by only reading through these slides. Only
  doing the practicals will allow you to actually learn how to do stuff.
