## The Unix operating system

.pull-left[
* An _operating system_ (OS) is a software that enables the use and manipulation
  of the different physical devices forming a computer.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* The Unix OS ([Ritchie and Thompson, 1974](https://doi.org/10.1145/361011.361061);
  [Kernighan and Pike, 1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment))
  was born on 1969 as a result of a research project
  at [Bell-Labs](http://www.bell-labs.com/history/unix), USA.

## The Unix operating system

* The group of engineers that developed Unix already made other attempts to
  develop an OS in the 60s, such as
  [Multics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics).  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* However, only after they developed the
  [B programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28programming_language%29)
  they succeeded to develop the first version of Unix, which was written in this
  language.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* The [B programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28programming_language%29)
  was the precursor of the widely-used
  [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29)
  ([Kernighan and Ritchie, 1978)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* There are many [variants](https://www.levenez.com/unix) of Unix, one of the
  most popular ones is [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) but also
  [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29),
  [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS)
  and [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) are based on a Unix OS.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* Did they use the Unix OS 50 years ago in the same way we use it now?

"Twenty years ago, a girl could be a secretary, a schoo teacher ... maybe
a librarian, a social worker or a nurse. If she was really ambitious, she could
go into the professions and compete with men ... usually working harder and
longer to earn less pay for the same job.

Now have come the big, dazzling computers -and **a whole new kind of work for
women: programming.**"

## The Unix operating system

* The Unix OS is organized into **layers**.  

![:scale 50%](img/unixlayers.png)

* The [_graphical user interface_ (GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)
  layer appeared later and the Unix OS was conceived to be used through the
  shell layer.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* The [_shell_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) layer is a
  [_command-line user interface_ (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
  that allows the user to interact with the computer by writing commands through a
  [_computer terminal_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal) or a
  [_terminal emulator_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator).

## The terminal window

![](img/terminals.png)

---

## The terminal window

* Nowadays, every OS (Windows, macOS or Linux) starts up with a GUI.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* The terminal window is just an application with an icon similar to this one:
  ![:scale 5%](img/terminal-app-icon.png)
* In Linux is located next to every other application.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* In macOS is located in `Applications -> Utilities`.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* In Windows you need to install some Unix emulator such as
  [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org) (using its Git Bash application).  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* Other options for Windows in increasing order of complexity are:
  * Running a Unix system in the [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)
  and access it through the browser. You require a stable internet connection and you
  normally have to pay for it.
  * Running a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) and installing
  in it a Linux system.
  * [Partitioning the hard drive disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning)
  and install Windows in one of the partitions,  
  and Linux in the other one.

---

## The terminal window

* At this point, you may ask yourself why do we want to work with a Unix
  command-line in a terminal window.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* The answer is because the command-line allows you to use computing in a
  modular, efficient and reproducible way:
  * Modularity: reusing and chaining computations.
  * Efficiency: automatizing workflows.
  * Reproducibility: recording computing steps.
* In summary, the command-line facilitates the release of your full potential
  as a computational biologist..

## The Unix filesystem

* A fundamental component of any OS is the
  [filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system) that the OS uses to
  store data.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* The filesystem determines the way in which files are organized and the GUIs
  in currently available OSs provide a graphical interface to this organisation.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* We want to learn here how to work with the filesystem through the Unix
  command-line:
  * High-level understanding about how the filesystem stores files in the
    computer.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * Learn filesystem commands and the syntax to specify them in the shell.

---

## The Unix filesystem

* A graphical representation of the Unix file system is through a
  [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard),
  sometimes referred to as a tree.

![:scale 90%](img/sfitxers.jpg)

* We have two main types of files in the filesystem: regular files and
  directories.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* Directories can store regular files and other directories.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* On top of the hierarchy we have the
  [root directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_directory), which can be
  likened to the trunk of a tree, as the starting point where all branches
  originate from.

---

## The Unix filesystem

* [Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29): unique location in the filesystem
  represented by a sequence of directories, optionally ending with a regular file, separated by
  the slash character `/`, for instance, `/home/professor/notes`  

![:scale 90%](img/sfitxers.jpg)

* When we start the shell in a terminal window, we have by default access to a specific
  working directory in the filesystem: our [home directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory),
  which can be coded in a path by writing the tilde character (`~`), e.g., `~/notes`    

---

## The Unix filesystem

* [Current working directory (CWD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory):
  directory where we have default access, which can be coded in a path by
  writing a dot (`.`), for instance, `./notes`

![:scale 90%](img/sfitxers.jpg)

* **Previous directory**: directory containing the CWD, which can be coded in a
  path by two consecutive dots (`..`): `../examens`  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* **Absolute path**: path starting at the root directory: `/home/professor/notes`  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* **Relative path**: path starting at some given CWD: `./notes`, `../examens`, etc.

---

## Unix commands

The syntax of Unix commands is the following:

`$ command [options] [arguments]`

where

  * **$**: is the [command prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command_prompt),
  which we **should not** write and merely indicates that the rest of the line should be written in
  the shell.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * **command**: is the name of the instruction that we want to execute. For instance, to
  copy a file we should use the command `cp`.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * **options**: one or more words starting with a hyphen (`-`) separated by spaces, i.e.,
  `-r` or `-lha`, that tune the behavior of the command.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * **arguments**: one or more words separated by spaces that specify input information that
  the command needs to perform its task.

The (square) brackets `[` and `]` are used above to indicate that not all commands have options
and arguments.

---

## Unix file commands

Examples of Unix commands that manipulate files:
  * listing files:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    `$ ls`  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * copying files:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    `$ cp ~/Downloads/data.zip .`  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * removing files:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    `$ rm data.zip`  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * showing CWD:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    `$ pwd`  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * changing CWD:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    `$ cd data`

---

## Unix commands to explore file contents

Examples of Unix commands that explore the contents of [text files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file):
  * beginning of a text file:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    `$ head filename`  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * end of a text file:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    `$ tail filename`  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * whole text file:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    `$ cat filename`  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  * paging text files:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    `$ more filename`

---

## Redirecting terminal output to a file

* Unix offers a mechanism to
[redirect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_%28computing%29)
to a file, the output printed in the terminal window.

`$ command > file`

![TerminalOutputRedirection](img/terminaloutputredirection.png)

## Concluding remarks

* Most Unix filesystems are case-sensitive, a wrong upper-case letter may lead to an error.
  Syntax must be precise and the
  [devil is in the detail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_devil_is_in_the_detail).  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
--

* The shell interprets commands by reading words separated by space characters.
  Using space characters in filenames becomes problematic in the command line.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
--

* **.red[DO NOT]** use spaces or any other non-standard
  [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) character such as `ñ`, `ç`,
  accents, etc., in filenames.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
--

* **.red[DO NOT]** use spaces or any other non-standard
  [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) character such as `ñ`, `ç`,
  accents, etc., in filenames.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
--

* Use [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)
  (e.g., `raw_data.csv`) or [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)
  (e.g., `rawData.csv`) instead of spaces to specify meaningful filenames.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
--

* You do not learn Unix and the command line by only reading through these
  slides. **You need to do the practicals and the assignments** to
  actually learn how to do stuff.
